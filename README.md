#Skiddie Malware Reversing

This pseudo-blog details my efforts reversing any script-kiddie malware samples 
that I come across. This would usually involve unpacking, then explaining what 
the sample is. If the unpacked malware isn't something that "common", I will 
make two posts for that sample; one for the unpacking and another for 
reversing the unpacked sample.  
I've reversed this kind of malware for a couple of years. Someone asked me to 
make a blog about it, so here it is!
