#Skiddie Malware Reversing

This pseudo-blog details my efforts reversing any script-kiddie malware samples 
<<<<<<< HEAD
that I come across, where "script-kiddie" here means "related to HackForums". 
This would usually involve unpacking, then explaining what the sample is. If 
the unpacked malware isn't something that "common", I will make two posts for 
that sample; one for the unpacking and another for reversing the unpacked 
sample.

I've reversed this kind of malware for a couple of years. Someone asked me to 
make a blog about it, so here it is!
